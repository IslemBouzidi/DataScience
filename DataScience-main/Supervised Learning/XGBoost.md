# XGBoost
`XGBoost` (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and widely used machine learning algorithm that falls under the category of ensemble learning techniques.
It's designed to handle both classification and regression tasks and has gained popularity due to its exceptional performance and versatility.


>"... _The impact of the system has beenwidely recognized in a number of machine learning and datamining challenges.Take the challenges hosted by the machine learning competition site Kaggle for example.
 Amongthe 29 challenge winning solutions 3 published at Kaggleâ€™sblog during 2015, 17 solutions used XGBoost. Among thesesolutions, eight solely used XGBoost to train the model,
 while most others combined XGBoost with neural nets in ensembles. For comparison, the second most popular method, deep neural nets, was used in 11 solutions. The success
 of the system was also witnessed in KDDCup 2015, whereXGBoost was used by every winning team in the top-10. Moreover, the winning teams reported that ensemble methods outperform a well-configured 
 XGBoost by only a small
